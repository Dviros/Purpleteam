Scripts i made to trigger events for SOC detections (MITRE ATTACK associated techniques mapping)

Detection and simulation are essential components of any security operations center (SOC).
Detection enables quick and accurate identification of potential threats, while simulation allows the SOC to test and refine detection strategies and incident response plans, as well as identify potential blind spots or gaps in security posture. Together, these two components ensure the SOC is prepared for any potential threat.
